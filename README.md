# Real-and-Fake-Detection-Code-Kaggle-
This Project consisted of Real and Fake Detection datsetfrom Kaggle.com. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection
The images that were given from the Kaggle website were used as testing images to see if there we have to detect if the images were real and/or fake
The images were resixed and saved to a folder in the C drive of my laptop.
The main step was to install the proper algorithms to initiate the sequence of real and fake detection such as "numpy" , "pandas", "scikit-learn", "opency-python" using the command line "System 32".
The proper algorithms for the code itself to be able to run is "Native Bayes", "K-Nearest Neighbor", "Decision Tree", and "Logistic Regression".
As a result the code generated a chart of each algorithms after scanning each image meaning the "Accuracy" and "Log Loss" of each image.
The full code is attached.
